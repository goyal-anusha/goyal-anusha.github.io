"3",2,"rw1189411","A film like this just couldn\'t be made in America, where action must occur at a slam-bang pace, and children must be either pitifully ignorant of life or else caricatures of evil. Here, there is exquisite attention to detail -- a countryside, a vase of flowers, and long periods with no dialog at all where a mood is simply allowed to develop. The passage of time may not be in equivalent ""real time,"" yet it passes noticeably. And what a skilled performance by Gleb Puskepalis, a boy with, as often seems to be the case, a distinguished acting history in legitimate theater. His character is master of his fate and of the plot, and he himself is master of the camera and the cast. I like this film especially because it is the boy who is rational, determined and self-directed, while the adults, as in reality, are continually made fools by their alcohol, aggression, and just wanting ""to f*** each other"" all the time.

"25",18,"rw0046571","At a time when many cineasts are beginning to respond to the beauties of Powell and Pressburger\'s ""Gone to Earth"", Wyler\'s ""Carrie"", that other most underrated masterpiece, continues to attract too little appreciative attention. It is not difficult to see why insofar that its depressing subject material is incompatible with audience expectations of its genre, Hollywood studio romanticism. It has a hero who slides into despair and degradation whilst the heroine succeeds in her chosen profession as an aspiring actress. Women who take their handkerchiefs to the cinema have always seemed indifferent to the film: indeed the only admirers I have personally found have been male, possibly identifying with the debonaire restaurateur, Hurstwood (magnificently played by Laurence Olivier), sowing the seeds of his downfall through human weakness which destroys everything except his innate dignity. Had the film been set in its own period (mid 20th century) and directed by, say, a De Sica or Kurosawa, we might still be talking about it. Instead it is set shortly after the beginning of the century, a transitional period when the romantic past was rapidly being overcome by the grainy realism of a new mechanised age. However, far from being weakened by the genre conventions of a highly romantic approach,the superbly crafted direction by William Wyler, photography perfectly composed by Victor Milner and a wonderfully lyrical score by David Raksin are elements that serve to enhance the material. They never sentimentalise it, somehow proving that when as here the Hollywood romantic cinema was given a really mature theme and text, it could, in the hands of some of its greatest craftsmen, be responsible for producing a work of the highest cinematic art.",10,"15 February 2002","jandesimpson","/user/ur1555753/","The Hollywood studio system at its finest","tt0044486"

Laurence Olivier\'s performance as Carrie\'s lover is sly and seductive, but there isn\'t any real chemistry between he and Jones, and Olivier could just as well be acting to a mirror (he\'s very good, very charismatic, and yet highly enamored of his own presence). Director William Wyler stages some dandy melodrama, but one still aches for much more than hand-wringing in a film with talents this big. The final sequence (set underneath a stairwell) is amazing both visually and emotionally, but too much of this story is balky or routine. None of the supporting players in the cast are allowed to outshine Larry Olivier; the picture may be called ""Carrie"", but all eyes are on the acting prince. ** from ****",5,"13 April 2008","moonspinner55","/user/ur0989035/","Collaboration for some wonderful talents is surprisingly mild...","tt0044486"

On the way, a blinding white light leaves her (and everyone else) unconscious, and also disables everything electronic. Unfortunately, like the movie\'s lead character, the director just wanders lost around this setting not knowing where to go with it. Random references to religion and humanity aside, the movie neither offers an explanation for the cause of the event, nor uses the setting in any meaningful way. Scenes just seem to randomly unfold without merit. Showing God (or was it Satan?) in a baseball cap may be an acceptable artistic decision, but him having to physically carry a bicycle out of the way to drive by in a car seems just too limiting for someone who brought about the ""End"".",2,"20 December 2010","shariqqq","/user/ur0290438/","Underwhelming","tt1794784"

We have mice, people, an octopus, whales, and dolphins mixed in a movie that has no focus. WHO CARES!?! They butchered a tragic story into a disgustingly simple ""good vs. evil"" play meant to inform people to stop hunting whales. By God, if you want to inform people about whales, do it somewhere else please. This movie also, deliberately, shamelessly, insults the people who died on that boat. It says everyone survived and were saved by whales. More of that dumb whale flashing again. It also doesn\'t have educational value, since it claims a gang of sharks told a giant octopus to throw an iceberg in front of the boat, and the boat sank.

"72",49,"rw3071503","This movie is just a disaster as the producers went way overboard with its outlandish story! The Legend of the Titanic is an Italian animated film directed by Orlando Corradi and Kim J. OK. The film is a very loose adaptation of the RMS Titanic sinking and told through several anthropomorphic animals. The movie starts out with old sailor-mouse named Top Connors (Voiced by Sean Patrick Lovett) telling his grandchildren the supposedly ""true"" story of the RMS Titanic. The movie then flashback to 1912, with a young Connors help a rich aristocratic human female named Elizabeth Camden (Voiced by Jane Alexander) overcome her arranged marriage to over the top evil whaler tycoon, Evarard Maltraver (Voiced by Gregory Snegoff). Instead, she falls in love with a poor gypsy named Don Juan (Voiced by Francis Pardeilhan). The Titanic then sets off to sea, only to lead to destruction events. If this plot shows familiar, it\'s a total rip-off of James Cameron 1997\'s Titanic. The plot gets worst, as the movie pretty offensive everybody, by claiming that nobody really died when Titanic sank because a giant dog-faced Octopus save everybody from the evil plot set up by whalers and talking sharks. This movie is an insult to all the victims that died that day by having little real life historical characters like Molly Brown, John Jacob Astor, and Thomas Andrews. It\'s an insult for history buffs and education when the movie lies out of its teeth with the ship having plenty of lifeboat with its historical contradictions. It\'s disgusting to watch a movie turn a tragic event like the Titanic sinking into a ploy to \'Save the Whale\' anti-whaling propaganda. The whole \'Saving the Whale\' exposition get so annoying by the end, because of how much, they mention it in the end. Due to the large amount of whale exposition, the film doesn\'t have any room to explain any other things in the film. First off, the love story. The two leads, fall in love with little to no story. I really don\'t get this Don Juan. How can he be a poor prince? Also, is Don Juan, the name of the legendary, fictional libertine womanizer? How on the world, is Elizabeth going to even have a stable relationship with him. The dude looks and acts like a stalker, like sniffing gloves. His dog is just as sick. The dog looks like about to cum, every time, somebody pet the dog. It\'s so creepy. I like how Elizabeth\'s father forced her to marry the whaler in the beginning, only later, throughout the film, change his mind for some odd reason about her, not marrying him. The whole villain plot to destroy the Titanic, to leave no witnesses to the whaling rights is just over the top. Tricking a dumb down giant Octopus for an iceberg throwing contest is one of the worst ideas, I have ever heard. Another lame lack of explaining, is the talking animals. The mice have little to no depth to them, only to be fed as supporting stock characters that seems to exist only to provide help to the main characters for some odd reason. Why would the mice help save the whales? It makes no sense. If they\'re not doing that, throughout most of the movie, they talk about boring ship protocol. The movie pace really slow down, when they talk endlessness about what to do, and what not to do on the ship. The movie even has the nerve to bring up racism when a mice is fantasizing about falling in love with a human female. It\'s not racism. It\'s just a weird bestiality fetish. It must had been some mistranslated from Italian, the films\' original language. They try some lame excuse like moonbeams, about why the human can hear the animals, but it doesn\'t make sense, since the main character, Elizabeth got the power from crying during a moonlight. Honestly, how on Earth is the bad guys talking to the sharks? Did they cry during the moonlight, too, because I didn\'t see that? How on earth is everybody on the ship able to talk to every animal? Did they all cry at the moonlight? It\'s so badly written. Don\'t get me with the talking dolphins that jump very high out of the water and seem to levitate! What was the writers smoking? While, the writing sucks. The animation isn\'t half-bad from the Italians. Still, it looks like they were trying really hard to make this movie into anime or something. It was flat and uninspired hand-drawn images as human characters look crossed eyed, and animals look ugly looking. While, computer animation was still in it infantile. In 1999, the computer animation should had gotten better. The limited computer animation used by this movie were pretty bad. Just look at the Brooklyn Bridge toward the end for an example. The English dubbing is terrible. Voice work is flimsy and oftentimes a vocal will be heard when an animated character\'s mouth is clearly wide open. They\'re talking, but mouth isn\'t moving in some scenes. Overall: This is worse than the 2001 animated Titanic film with a similar name. The Legend of the Titanic was followed by a 2004 sequel titled Tentacolino which is just awful. These movies successfully bludgeon the intelligence of children and adults alike, with insultingly stupidity. The only reason to watch it, is how laughably bad, it is. Even with that, it\'s still painful to watch.",1,"19 August 2014","ironhorse_iv","/user/ur34049683/","This movie sunk a new low with its floating BS!!","tt1623780"
"73",50,"rw0128442","DOROTHEAS RACHE begins with the characters talking directly to the camera and thus us, the viewers. But this is only one of the many, many pleasantly weird things you\'ll discover when watching this film. Right at the beginning we learn that Dorothea, who introduces herself as a 17 year old girl, has just made love to a Martian. And she even has a groovy, smoking meteorite to prove it. The parents are concerned if the pill will work in the case of interstellar sex ... The rest of the film follows Dorothea as she tries to learn more about love (both emotionally and physically) and ends up being abused again and again by an amazing parade of creeps and freaks before Jesus Christ himself pops up to give her some good advice ... Did I mention that this film is weird? The thing that cracked me up the most was Dorothea\'s father who runs a firm that produces ""laughing bags"". That\'s some kind of small mechanism that\'s in a metal box and is then put into a bag. When you shake the bag you are treated to hysterical laughter ... Awesome, just awesome!

"74",51,"rw1716656","Though primarily intended to be a parody on the then-notorious wave of German sex-films that claim to be ""scientifically"" accurate, ""Dorotheas Rache"" won a price as best picture of 1974. And if that wasn\'t good enough, the price is the Prix de Group Panic, donated by the brilliant cinematic trio infernal consisting of playwright/artist Roland Topor (best known to film lovers as the author who provided the story for Roman Polanskis ""Le Tenant""), neo-surrealistic director Fernando Arrabal (""Viva la Muerte"") and multi-talented filmmaker-genius Alejandro Jodorowsky (""El Topo""). The three applauded ""Dorothea"" as a masterpiece of the new, larger-than-life, politically reflective film of the post-68 years. It offers, they stated, thought-provocation in a daring, symbolist manner that resembles a mix-up of Pasolini and Breton. And indeed, director Peter Fleischmann and fellow screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière (long-time collaborator of Luis Bunuel) have gone to the limits with this passion of a young girl in search for the meaning of love. Almost all the actors are non-professionals from the sinister underworld of St. Pauli, Hamburg. Anna Henkel – who later starred in Bernardo Bertoluccis ""1900"" and still later married famous German pop singer Herbert Grönemeyer, but tragically died of cancer at a young age – is brilliant as the 17-year old protagonist on her journey through darkness, weirdness, obscurity and obscenity. While trying to find out about the nature of love and the magnetic force between the sexes, she stumbles across pornographers, prostitutes and dominatrices, all of them deliberately depicted not as bizarre caricatures, and all of them behaving as if their home ground were the suburbs of a sex-loaded hellfire. Eventually, Dorothea\'s trip turns out to be a rite of passage in the midst of a capitalistic system. As first, there\'s her parental background: Her father owns a factory that produces comedy articles (such as jewel cases that provide laughter when opened), her mother is as average and boring as a mother can be – but only at first sight. Dorothea slowly evades from this surrounding into unknown territory when a friend, with whom she is making a hilariously absurd 8mm film called ""Encyclopedia of Love"" (devoted to the weirdest sexual practices you have ever been advised to re-enact) starts posing for pornographic pictures and is sexually abused during the first session. Both disgusted and attracted at the same time, and being broad-minded as can be, Dorothea starts trying it out herself. It\'s all done for her quest for the meaning of love in a world of exploitation, humiliation and perversity. Stations of Dorotheas passion include her being laid by three old, very unattractive men (full frontal nudity here, even ""fuller"" than usual!), with the girl surprising the men by turning the situation around. Subsequently there are her lesbian experiences with a domina (among whose clients is a single-legged masochist that likes to be crucified), her (harshly punished) attempt to be a nice to an unloved, frustrated man even prostitutes don\'t want as a customer, her idea to comfort her fathers economical problems with incest, and a personal encounter with Jesus who advises Dorothea to have sex with the mad and the lunatic to become happy\x85 It sounds like a porn-revue from the asylum, and in some way, it is. But it\'s also an astonishing insight, a hallucinating voyage seen through the eyes of an, after all, innocent girl that tries to understand why things are the way they are. She keeps her innocence throughout her experiences – almost, at all (there\'s one ""guilt"" appearing out of the middle all those unredeemed sins). German writer Martin Walser called it a film in ""Dosto-Sado-Maso-Jewski""-qualities when it came out, newspapers spoke of a ""moralistic fable"", of ""Sex with a slice of Mao"", and the film was nicknamed the ""Maria Magdalena of the red-light district"" or ""Alice in Sexland"". Views may vary, but there\'s no doubt ""Dorotheas Rache"" is an amour fou with erotic tension being the prime subject of a surrealistic roller-coaster ride.",10,"22 August 2007","Thorsten_B","/user/ur2317131/","Dosto-Sado-Maso-Jewski","tt0069999"

Speaking of Stallone, both he and Sharon Stone have a believability factor deficiency of monumental proportions. In fact the entire movie has a believability factor of less than zero.

"101",66,"rw3707614","This movie begins in Colombia with two men named ""Ray Quick"" (Sylvester Stallone) and ""Ned Trent"" (James Woods) getting ready to blow up a car being driven by a drug lord when Ray spots a child in the backseat and tells Ned to abort the mission. But when his partner refuses--and the bomb subsequently explodes and kills both passengers--a fight ensues which results in extremely bad feelings between them afterward. The scene then shifts to Miami where a beautiful woman named ""May Munro"" (Sharon Stone) has requested that Ray kill three men who murdered her parents when she was a child. The problem is that Ray is an explosives expert and doesn\'t feel comfortable with the job at hand. But after following May in order to gather more information concerning the task at hand he reluctantly agrees. Yet even though his assignment is certainly difficult, what he doesn\'t know is that Ned has formed an uneasy business partnership with these men, and he has been forewarned that Ray might be coming after them. Needless to say, Ned would love another opportunity to get back at Ray for what happened earlier. At any rate, having reviewed the basic plot I must admit that, in spite of the solid cast, this film turned out to be more than a little disappointing. For starters, it appeared that neither Sylvester Stallone nor Sharon Stone really cared that much about this film and simply went through the motions.

Sly Stallone mumbles so badly that only about 5% of his dialogue is intelligible (though this is probably a plus, given the quality of the writing).Sharon Stone is nice to look at but her acting starts off bad and gets worse in a hurry. Her character is so unlikeable I cheered up when Woods slapped her around. Rod Steiger\'s accent, which I believe is supposed to be Cuban because he pronounces ""you"" as ""chew"" a la Scarface, comes and goes. James Woods plays a parody of himself (this was actually the most entertaining thing about the movie). They show Sly working out, and all he does are ballet-like stretches to show off his bod, and it was not a pretty sight. He is so over-pumped that there are alarmingly bulging veins on every inch of his body visible. Stone and Stallone (has a nice ring to it, huh?) have no chemistry--during their big sex scene, they look extremely bored instead of aroused, as if they are about to doze off but the only thing keeping them awake is to make sure their buff bodies are displayed carefully so they look their best on camera.  Continuity is terrible-Sly\'s character adopts a fluffy grey kitty, which I guess is supposed to make him sensitive (I was just worried he\'d crush it accidentally) but in a scene towards the end, the cat is dark brown. I give a grudging point towards the kitty not being killed by the Columbians or Woods--the one thing that I didn\'t see coming, because every time Sly came home looking for his cat I expected him to find it nailed to the wall or something equally hideous. Woods does have a great scene (a couple, really) where he does a little trick with a pen and some plastique to frighten his office staff. I also laughed at the way he\'d constantly be yelling ""Shut up!"" to characters who hadn\'t even said anything yet.The movie is, I have to admit, one of those that is so bad, it would qualify as one of those \'love to hate it\' movies that you sit around with your friends with to watch and make fun of. Worth renting if 1. you are a Woods fan and find him entertaining in any movie no matter how terrible it is or 2. you have a free rental coming at the video store (or both of the above, like me).

"175",121,"rw3134910","I had the pleasure of watching ""Qissa"" (Punjabi, English sub-titles) at its North America premier at the Sikh Lens Film Festival in Orange County, CA on Nov 22nd, 2014. This is a complex, heart-wrenching tale powerfully etched by the dexterous hands of Anup Singh. The movie starts off with the backdrop of the 1947 Partition of India and the theme of loss runs right through it. The film then goes on to mercilessly expose the ridiculous limits a patriarchy must go to, to preserve itself. Umber (played by the incomparable Irrfan Khan) is a Sikh man uprooted with his wife and three young daughters from his village (in Pakistan) and forced to flee to the new India as a result of Partition. Soon after he is somewhat reestablished in India, his wife delivers a 4th daughter; at this point Umber declares he\'s had a son and brushing aside all objections proceeds to raise the girl as a boy even up to the point of marrying her off as a man. The absolutism of the patriarchy, accompanied by the threat of violence runs as an undercurrent throughout the film — the women mostly watch on helplessly until Umber\'s daughter-in-law unexpectedly decides to question the status quo. But it is too late and the story unfolds inexorably into a disaster for all. Thematically Partition as the starting point for the film is a powerful and relevant one. The patriarchy that invented the concept of ""honor"" off the backs of its helpless women then greatly exploited it during Partition - women, girls on all sides and as a matter of priority, were raped, mutilated, and devastated in ways unimaginable. The same patriarchy so bound to its feudal ties, the land it owned and a limited imagination, could only consider sons bearing its name. And this became so much of a part of the reality that not having a male heir became as much a matter of economic devastation as of social shame. As the director and screenplay writer, Anup Singh displays admirable restraint with limited dialog, nuanced performances elicited from his cast, and the straightforward telling of an explosive story. A metaphorical twist in the story leaves you stunned yet believing. I would be remiss if I did not call out the three women actors - Tilottama Shome, Tisca Chopra and Rasika Dugal - who were perfect in their respective roles; each held her own vis-a-vis Irrfan Khan.

To desire is not a sin, but to go beyond reality to fulfill your desire is definitely a sin and a bane for the society and the people associated with it. The movie becomes quite confusing at some point and one is not able to decide whether Irfan Khan is really a ghost or not.

Although things go quite smooth at first, once Sheffield tells him more of the details, Rontell has him kidnapped not too long afterward and forces him to sign a power of attorney which authorizes him to withdraw large amounts of money from the local bank. At the same time, he dispatches some hired thugs to burn down the houses and terrorize the people on those lands into eventually selling their property over to him--all while pretending to be outraged over these attacks.

Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an okay film which, because of the obvious limitations of the film industry at the time, might require the viewer to make certain allowances.

In fact, Stack’s the right-hand man of a notorious bandit – dubbed “El Tigre”; when confronted by Rooney, Stack confesses to being indebted to the Mexican…but when ultimately revealed, the latter’s true identity greatly dismays Rooney (a clue: Stack and the bandit never appear together in the same scene!). Anyway, the film is unassuming and pretty forgettable but, at the same time, watchable enough; on the plus side is an appropriately foreign look (the production company took the trouble of shooting on location, albeit in a studio – the hacienda setting, incidentally, would soon become a staple of Mexican horror efforts!), as well as the imposing and reliable presence of Robert Preston as the Ranger out to capture “El Tigre”.

I\'m not calling unfunny, just completely foreign to the point of surrealism. People are placing it in the same class as Tomcats, PCU, The Ladies Man, etc., because of its shock value. But what it most reminded me of was Pink Flamingos, and The Andalusian Dog. This movie was significantly re-edited before release, and I hope that there is a director\'s cut released someday.

This films spans the period of 1983 to 1993 in a provincial town in China and it stars the wonderful Yi Liu as Yun. In 1983, Yun gets pregnant while still in school, causing a scandal. She gives birth but is told the baby was dead. Ten years later and Yun is an opera singer for the locals, having an affair with a married man. You meet Xiao Wong, a 10 year old boy who comes in contact with her. At first annoying her (her nickname for him is ""Little Bastard""), you soon see a connection between them.

"420",288,"rw3338351","Sean Astin and Chris Mukley provide fine performances in director Gil Cates Jr. suspenseful film centered on two desperate men who have a chance meeting in the middle of Lake Michigan. Mitch (Astin) is determined to kill himself because he blames himself for his father\'s death in a factory accident. Kelly Enright (Mulkey) crashes his plane into the Lake while on a delivery of a backpack with $125,000 for either drugs or black market human body parts. Both men are desperately searching for hope and identity in their lives. The videography is stunning, and the writing creates a realistic give and take of hostility until each man realizes he must depend upon the other for survival. The film begins with a dream-like sequence of Mitch preparing for his trip out onto Lake Michigan (and his eventual suicide). He meticulously preps for his day, fills a bird feeder with enough seed to last several weeks, then visits his mother (who is suffering from Alzheimer\'s disease) in a nursing home. After making certain that everything he is leaving behind is in order, Mitch motors his father\'s small fishing boat out into the lake. Soon Mitch discovers the wreckage of a small plane and pulls the pilot (Kelly), who had been clinging to part of one of the wings, into his craft. The remainder of the film entails Mitch and Kelly discussing bleaker anecdotes of life that all of us experience and, often, keep to ourselves. Mitch has suffered the loss of his girlfriend through a skate boarding accident, the death of his father through the warehouse accident, and his mother to Alzheimer\'s. Through a chance cell phone call from the men who are awaiting Kelly\'s arrival with the money, Mitch is able to contact 911 and both men are rescued by the Coast Guard stationed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By the time of the rescue both men have helped each discover that hope survives. As Kelly said to Mitch during one of Mitch\'s self-indulgent diatribes, ""...don\'t do that to yourself [...] people have choices..."". This is a must see Indy film.

It was a fairly expensive film for them then ($450K) and filmed in colour. As a film it is a very effective multicultural experience and it is a credit to them to take such a risk on what one would think was then un marketable themes: illegal immigrant Chinese boy is adopted by land owning red Indian family, who send him to school. Kid gets taunted because of his new family and Chinese face. Pop, Anthony Quinn discovers oil on the farm and gets rich. They buy a racehorse and it becomes a champ and they become richer! Racial prejudice gets and airing too when they enter\' society\'. All quite startling and effectively handled. For these themes to be their first high profile calling card, AA/Monogram get a good report and deserve recognition for their worthy ideals.

I understood that there was a man seeking a cure for his dying sister, but that was about all. The movie moves from scene to scene without giving the audience enough information as to who is who and what everybody wants. The sorry story (which Lam wrote) may have been tolerable had it been for some good action movies, but honestly, the action in the movie isn\'t all that special. It\'s kind of slow and sluggish, to tell the truth.
