To call it slow-paced would be to call sloths sprinters but that is not necessarily a deficit. 90 per cent of the shots begin as Extra Wide taking in all the colorless terrain and occasionally introducing movement via people and, even more occasionally, traffic. Although shot in color the landscape remains resolutely grey. There's also a penchant for holding a shot for long moments after the characters have exited and in this it resembles Goodbye, Dragon Inn. Nevertheless we find ourselves watching the father and son as they make their very slow way to the Crimea having, we are told, started from Moscow. Along the way we learn, or discover, that the father is a recovering alcoholic and that the Koktebel to which he is taking his son no longer exists, at least not under that name, a metaphor for lives that must change or disappear. The film has to be carried by the two principals but there is decent support from a railway worker, a teenage girl, a householder and a doctor with no patients. It's not going to make a fortune but films like this deserve to be seen as a counterpoint to the formulaic."", 'rating_value': '7', 'review_date': '11 January 2005', 'reviewer_name': 'writers_reign', 'reviewer_url': '/user/ur2567136/', 'short_review': 'Road To Utopia'}"

tt0372366,"{'data-review-id': 'rw0993291', 'full_review': ""I have just seen this film at the Renoir in London, and found much to enjoy. At first the basic story-line of the father looking for a haven and the boy for a world of adventure and freedom, seemed slow-moving but the early long takes gave the viewer time to absorb the landscape and the point-of-view, in particular the boy's slow awakening to the reality of his situation. His ability to 'see everything from above', demonstrated to the forest-dwelling girl early in the film when he drew a map of a terrain unknown to him, was an early signal of his superior grasp of reality and an introduction to the main metaphorical cluster of the film. The use of birds, glider and flying-paper imagery rang the changes on the visual representation of the boy's yearnings; a galaxy of Dostoyevsian larger-than-life and twice-as-unpredictable Russian characters met along the way added intrigue and ethnic authenticity to the story-line. The bizarre minor characters contrasted with the down-to-earth ordinariness of the tensions between the father and son. Their habitats were astonishing and yet completely acceptable within the heightened realism established in the early scenes - the railworker's shed with the lavatory doubling as a vodka store - the tumble-down mansion whose roof the father stayed to repair with disastrous consequences, the hillside ox-roast with flying sparks visible for miles and a suddenly-looming lorry-driver big as Brian Blessed hefting the boy across his shoulders with a triumphant cry of 'Meat! and a chill echo of 'Texas Chain Saw '.The Amazonian, silent 'Xenia', for all her 'sweatiness' complained of by the boy, was given a similarly apocryphal persona. All were separated by muddy fields and clawing shrubland which the camera allowed us to experience as visually alienating at a distance and unbearably uncomfortable up close. Questions raised were as much about Russian geography and history as about the central relationship and its outcome. By the end, the mention of 'Koktebel', whose very absence from the atlas referred to a historical shift in identity, carried the resonance of Chekhov's 'Moscow', in his masterpiece about longing and nostalgia, 'Three Sisters'. At the end of the film, when the uncertain pleasures of routine existence versus an ungraspable freedom had been clearly delineated, the binding ties of father and son remained as unresolved and problematic as at the beginning. Like the evenly-matched wrestlers in the hillside firelight, they were forced to declare an uneasy truce."", 'rating_value': '8', 'review_date': '1 January 2005', 'reviewer_name': 'sheilacornuk', 'reviewer_url': '/user/ur4129807/', 'short_review': 'A thoroughly Russian Mystery'}"

To say that it is about a journey to a ' better ' place which in this case is a a seaside pleasure resort in Crimea is to simplify. It is a place called Koktebel and a young middle aged man and his eleven year old son intend to reach it, and it is above all the young son's dream to get there. Father/son relationships have been depicted before in Russian cinema in many different ways, and their significance is probably difficult to understand in Western culture. In the West directors like Bogdanovich and Wenders have depicted daughters, whereas in Russia ( it seems to me ) male bonding has a stronger pull. In ' Koktebel ' the father who has fallen on bad times has to find a place to live and as his wife is dead he bears sole responsibility for his son's future. No spoilers but after many troubled incidents the two break apart, and the son alone in a desolate muddy field has a critical breakdown, sobbing that ' it is finished '. I interpreted it that his real childhood was finished and that he was too young to bear that. The actor who plays the son is superb, and for me he was the tragic focus of the film. Alone he continues the journey. I wondered as I watched about the true meaning of this cinematic masterpiece. Is disillusionment the fate of all of us who travel in life ? Is the journey better without the hope of a place where life will supposedly fulfil our fantasies and needs ? Many have written of the visual beauty in this film, and yes there is a beauty in the landscapes and also a beauty in the ' things ' however ' ugly ' that surround the various characters. All of this is here in ' Koktebel ' but for me it was the loss of childhood innocence of the son - and yes, of his father in his own youth that moved me to tears. A great, great film that needs many viewings and finally I feel its major achievement is in the not so simple fact that each and all of us must move on, and that finally our personal Ithaca is totally different from what we hoped for."", 'rating_value': '10', 'review_date': '22 July 2023', 'reviewer_name': 'jromanbaker', 'reviewer_url': '/user/ur68129390/', 'short_review': 'Better the journey than to arrive'}"

The brilliance of this film is that each scene clearly expresses an idea and the audience is able to understand and sympathize with emotions and events that would be hard to put into words. For me the landscape seemed oppressive and gloomy. Of course in some ways it's beautiful but that's only a perception, and if the audience enters into the spirit of the characters then i don't think they'd find the scenery attractive. I also found the drawn out shots demonstrated the immensity of everything, the length of the voyage, the effort that the characters have to make everyday just to keep going.

It centres on a father and son as they make their way from Moscow to the Crimea. Without money, they have to hitch lifts, get work when they can and rely on others' generosity. The film has enormous potential that is almost completely wasted by the directors. The cinematography (which clearly could make a film like this wonderful) is bad. The directors take the 'banale detail' camera-work to a new level in a clear imitation of better Russian directors (like Tarkovsky or Sokhurov), but carry it off badly, so that it becomes boring and sentimental. This is a real shame, since the Russian landscape is exceptionally beautiful in its sparseness and this is hardly captured at all. The directors are probably trying to show the the point of view of the 11-year-old protagonist, but it results in a pretentious and cloying film. Neither the script nor the acting are so bad, but the directors make unfair demands on the child actor playing the son, spoiling what would have otherwise been a solid performance. There are occasional good scenes, but the narrative lacks continuity and is horribly self-conscious (social stereotypes appear from the wings, making it seem like the directors have a tick-list of emotions they want to convey).

It is not difficult to see why insofar that its depressing subject material is incompatible with audience expectations of its genre, Hollywood studio romanticism. It has a hero who slides into despair and degradation whilst the heroine succeeds in her chosen profession as an aspiring actress. Women who take their handkerchiefs to the cinema have always seemed indifferent to the film: indeed the only admirers I have personally found have been male, possibly identifying with the debonaire restaurateur, Hurstwood (magnificently played by Laurence Olivier), sowing the seeds of his downfall through human weakness which destroys everything except his innate dignity. Had the film been set in its own period (mid 20th century) and directed by, say, a De Sica or Kurosawa, we might still be talking about it. Instead it is set shortly after the beginning of the century, a transitional period when the romantic past was rapidly being overcome by the grainy realism of a new mechanised age. However, far from being weakened by the genre conventions of a highly romantic approach,the superbly crafted direction by William Wyler, photography perfectly composed by Victor Milner and a wonderfully lyrical score by David Raksin are elements that serve to enhance the material. They never sentimentalise it, somehow proving that when as here the Hollywood romantic cinema was given a really mature theme and text, it could, in the hands of some of its greatest craftsmen, be responsible for producing a work of the highest cinematic art.', 'rating_value': '10', 'review_date': '15 February 2002', 'reviewer_name': 'jandesimpson', 'reviewer_url': '/user/ur1555753/', 'short_review': 'The Hollywood studio system at its finest'}"

Dreiser's themes in his novels dealt heavily with society and his characters' desire to or lack of desire to conform with the rest of the people around them. The people's morality and/or scruples was always foremost in Dreiser's mind. This film, Carrie, is no exception. Carrie leaves home in the country to make it on her own in the big city of Chicago, I believe, and Eddie Albert immediately thrusts his attention on her. He seems nice enough, trying to befriend her and give her money that is much needed and it seems innocent enough. But we also don't know his intentions or what he's thinking, either. The plain facts don't sound good at all. When her brother and his wife, that she was staying with in the big city, find out she took money from a total stranger, Eddie Albert, after losing her job, they don't want her to stay. Nice girls don't take money from strange men. Period. But she then is tricked by Eddie in living with him. An unmarried woman living with a man! This too is shunned. He obviously had his own plans all along and marriage was not part of it. Then she is introduced to Laurence Olivier, who is a respected head waiter at a posh restaurant. She falls for him, not knowing he's married. He never told her. When wife Miriam Hopkins finds out, the fur flies. To tell anymore would be telling the whole film. But while Jennifer Jones is always beautiful and is the title character, the film really belongs to Laurence Olivier. I've not seen many of his films, particularly not any of his Shakesperean films; I have seen only Rebecca and Wuthering Heights. But watching him as a man who supposedly had it all with a successful career and a family and his downward spiral into loving another woman is really something to witness. And, I 've never seen him looking more distinguished, (handsome with his graying temples - I had never seen him or thought of him in that way until this film,) dapper, and more like a real, vulnerable, and complex man than he is here in this film. Director William Wyler's production values making us the viewers delve into the mindset of Theodore Dreiser's characters and Olivier's performance are superlative, making this a film not to be missed by serious film buffs, especially those interested in the mores of yesteryear. The ending may be a bit vague for some who don't pick up on subtlety or those who are unsure of their own beliefs.

In April 1912, Conners was a young sailor mouse on the Titanic\'s maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York. He is in charge of taking account for the mice who are making the trip. A young mouse from Brazil named Ronny who enjoys playing soccer befriends Conners and Conners falls in love with Ronny\'s sister Stella. Meanwhile, a rich aristocratic woman named Elizabeth and her family board the Titanic. Her father is a famous Duke and is very prominent in the whaling business. He and Elizabeth\'s stepmother have arranged for Elizabeth to marry Mr. Evarard Maltravers, a rich whaler. Unknown to the Duke, the marriage is actually a scheme concocted by his own stepwife and Maltravers to get certain whaling rights for themselves. Elizabeth is unhappy about the marriage. Elizabeth sees several gypsies dancing at the dock and happily watches them. A gypsy man named Don Juan is dancing with his dog Smiley. He notices Elizabeth and sends Smiley to see her. When Elizabeth takes off one of her gloves to pet Smiley, Smiley snatches it and takes it back to Juan. Juan looks at Elizabeth and the two instantly fall in love. The Titanic then sets off to sea from Southampton on her first, and only, voyage. Conners and Ronny learn all about what\'s going on with Elizabeth by their observations during their trips throughout the ship\'s ventilation system. They are appalled by the way Elizabeth is being treated badly and decide to help her. When Elizabeth goes to the bow of the ship one night, some dolphins talk to her due to some magic moonbeams. The dolphins jump very high out of the water and seem to levitate. They tell her of Maltravers\'s evil scheme. Maltravers\'s manservant Geoffreys spies on Elizabeth\'s activities and uses a special whistle at the stern of the ship to call the criminal shark named Mr. Ice and use him for causing destruction. Conners and Ronny introduce themselves to Elizabeth and offer to help her. Listening to their advice, Elizabeth tells her father she doesn\'t want to marry Maltravers. He listens to his daughter and tells her that he will never force her to do something she doesn\'t want to do. Meanwhile, Smiley tries to look for Elizabeth to cheer up Juan. After he unsuccessfully tries to find her in the ship\'s ballroom, he meets Conners and Ronny, who agree to help arrange a meeting and dance for Elizabeth and Juan. The meeting goes according to schedule and Elizabeth and Juan dance and kiss together. Elizabeth tells her father that she wants to marry Juan, and he agrees, but Elizabeth\'s stepmother is furious. When Elizabeth tells her stepmother that she should marry Maltravers, she storms off in anger, despite the fact that they both flirt constantly (this might just be the fact that they\'re scheming together). Elizabeth\'s stepmother and Maltravers decide to do things drastically now, as it\'s clear that Elizabeth will not marry him. They decide to sink the Titanic using the help of Mr. Ice and his gang of criminal sharks. Maltravers prepares to send news to his whaling ships by telegraph, and the mice decide to chew apart the wires to stop it from being sent. Ice and his gang of sharks decide to let an iceberg sink the Titanic. They fool an octopus named Tentacles with a dog\'s nose into heaving an iceberg to the surface of the ocean by concealing the plan in the form of a bet to see who can throw ice the farthest. On the Titanic, the Duke is forced to sign the whaling rights to Maltravers and his stepwife at gunpoint. Maltravers and his entourage escape the Titanic in a lifeboat. The crew of the Titanic then see the iceberg and attempt to avoid it, but the Titanic hits the berg anyway, due to the sharks blocking the rudder. The Titanic then quickly begins to sink, and the dolphins berate Tentacles for endangering the hundreds of lives on board the Titanic, and then Tentacles runs to the Titanic in an attempt to stall for time for the passengers who were still on board the Titanic to escape the ship, including Captain Edward Smith. The mice realize that because they have cut the telegraph wires, the ship can\'t send out a call for help. They enlist the help of another mouse friend of theirs, named Camembert, to help repair the wires. They are unable to do it, but Camembert gets the idea to attach the halves of the cut wire to his moustache. They do so, and Camembert somehow dies because of this. Elizabeth and Juan manage to save her father, as he was tied up in a chair by Maltravers, and manage to put him on a lifeboat. Tentacles notices that the Titanic is breaking in two and then comes a series of entertaining events till the end. Absolutely A Great Film That You Must See.

tt1623780,"{'data-review-id': 'rw3071503', 'full_review': 'This movie is just a disaster as the producers went way overboard with its outlandish story! The Legend of the Titanic is an Italian animated film directed by Orlando Corradi and Kim J. OK. The film is a very loose adaptation of the RMS Titanic sinking and told through several anthropomorphic animals. The movie starts out with old sailor-mouse named Top Connors (Voiced by Sean Patrick Lovett) telling his grandchildren the supposedly ""true"" story of the RMS Titanic. The movie then flashback to 1912, with a young Connors help a rich aristocratic human female named Elizabeth Camden (Voiced by Jane Alexander) overcome her arranged marriage to over the top evil whaler tycoon, Evarard Maltraver (Voiced by Gregory Snegoff). Instead, she falls in love with a poor gypsy named Don Juan (Voiced by Francis Pardeilhan). The Titanic then sets off to sea, only to lead to destruction events. If this plot shows familiar, it\'s a total rip-off of James Cameron 1997\'s Titanic. The plot gets worst, as the movie pretty offensive everybody, by claiming that nobody really died when Titanic sank because a giant dog-faced Octopus save everybody from the evil plot set up by whalers and talking sharks. This movie is an insult to all the victims that died that day by having little real life historical characters like Molly Brown, John Jacob Astor, and Thomas Andrews. It\'s an insult for history buffs and education when the movie lies out of its teeth with the ship having plenty of lifeboat with its historical contradictions. It\'s disgusting to watch a movie turn a tragic event like the Titanic sinking into a ploy to \'Save the Whale\' anti-whaling propaganda. The whole \'Saving the Whale\' exposition get so annoying by the end, because of how much, they mention it in the end. Due to the large amount of whale exposition, the film doesn\'t have any room to explain any other things in the film. First off, the love story. The two leads, fall in love with little to no story. I really don\'t get this Don Juan. How can he be a poor prince? Also, is Don Juan, the name of the legendary, fictional libertine womanizer? How on the world, is Elizabeth going to even have a stable relationship with him. The dude looks and acts like a stalker, like sniffing gloves. His dog is just as sick. The dog looks like about to cum, every time, somebody pet the dog. It\'s so creepy. I like how Elizabeth\'s father forced her to marry the whaler in the beginning, only later, throughout the film, change his mind for some odd reason about her, not marrying him. The whole villain plot to destroy the Titanic, to leave no witnesses to the whaling rights is just over the top. Tricking a dumb down giant Octopus for an iceberg throwing contest is one of the worst ideas, I have ever heard. Another lame lack of explaining, is the talking animals. The mice have little to no depth to them, only to be fed as supporting stock characters that seems to exist only to provide help to the main characters for some odd reason. Why would the mice help save the whales? It makes no sense. If they\'re not doing that, throughout most of the movie, they talk about boring ship protocol. The movie pace really slow down, when they talk endlessness about what to do, and what not to do on the ship. The movie even has the nerve to bring up racism when a mice is fantasizing about falling in love with a human female. It\'s not racism. It\'s just a weird bestiality fetish. It must had been some mistranslated from Italian, the films\' original language. They try some lame excuse like moonbeams, about why the human can hear the animals, but it doesn\'t make sense, since the main character, Elizabeth got the power from crying during a moonlight. Honestly, how on Earth is the bad guys talking to the sharks? Did they cry during the moonlight, too, because I didn\'t see that? How on earth is everybody on the ship able to talk to every animal? Did they all cry at the moonlight? It\'s so badly written. Don\'t get me with the talking dolphins that jump very high out of the water and seem to levitate! What was the writers smoking? While, the writing sucks. The animation isn\'t half-bad from the Italians. Still, it looks like they were trying really hard to make this movie into anime or something. It was flat and uninspired hand-drawn images as human characters look crossed eyed, and animals look ugly looking. While, computer animation was still in it infantile. In 1999, the computer animation should had gotten better. The limited computer animation used by this movie were pretty bad. Just look at the Brooklyn Bridge toward the end for an example. The English dubbing is terrible. Voice work is flimsy and oftentimes a vocal will be heard when an animated character\'s mouth is clearly wide open. They\'re talking, but mouth isn\'t moving in some scenes. Overall: This is worse than the 2001 animated Titanic film with a similar name. The Legend of the Titanic was followed by a 2004 sequel titled Tentacolino which is just awful.

tt0069999,"{'data-review-id': 'rw1716656', 'full_review': 'Though primarily intended to be a parody on the then-notorious wave of German sex-films that claim to be ""scientifically"" accurate, ""Dorotheas Rache"" won a price as best picture of 1974. And if that wasn\'t good enough, the price is the Prix de Group Panic, donated by the brilliant cinematic trio infernal consisting of playwright/artist Roland Topor (best known to film lovers as the author who provided the story for Roman Polanskis ""Le Tenant""), neo-surrealistic director Fernando Arrabal (""Viva la Muerte"") and multi-talented filmmaker-genius Alejandro Jodorowsky (""El Topo""). The three applauded ""Dorothea"" as a masterpiece of the new, larger-than-life, politically reflective film of the post-68 years. It offers, they stated, thought-provocation in a daring, symbolist manner that resembles a mix-up of Pasolini and Breton. And indeed, director Peter Fleischmann and fellow screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière (long-time collaborator of Luis Bunuel) have gone to the limits with this passion of a young girl in search for the meaning of love. Almost all the actors are non-professionals from the sinister underworld of St. Pauli, Hamburg. Anna Henkel – who later starred in Bernardo Bertoluccis ""1900"" and still later married famous German pop singer Herbert Grönemeyer, but tragically died of cancer at a young age – is brilliant as the 17-year old protagonist on her journey through darkness, weirdness, obscurity and obscenity. While trying to find out about the nature of love and the magnetic force between the sexes, she stumbles across pornographers, prostitutes and dominatrices, all of them deliberately depicted not as bizarre caricatures, and all of them behaving as if their home ground were the suburbs of a sex-loaded hellfire. Eventually, Dorothea\'s trip turns out to be a rite of passage in the midst of a capitalistic system. As first, there\'s her parental background: Her father owns a factory that produces comedy articles (such as jewel cases that provide laughter when opened), her mother is as average and boring as a mother can be – but only at first sight. Dorothea slowly evades from this surrounding into unknown territory when a friend, with whom she is making a hilariously absurd 8mm film called ""Encyclopedia of Love"" (devoted to the weirdest sexual practices you have ever been advised to re-enact) starts posing for pornographic pictures and is sexually abused during the first session. Both disgusted and attracted at the same time, and being broad-minded as can be, Dorothea starts trying it out herself. It\'s all done for her quest for the meaning of love in a world of exploitation, humiliation and perversity. Stations of Dorotheas passion include her being laid by three old, very unattractive men (full frontal nudity here, even ""fuller"" than usual!), with the girl surprising the men by turning the situation around. Subsequently there are her lesbian experiences with a domina (among whose clients is a single-legged masochist that likes to be crucified), her (harshly punished) attempt to be a nice to an unloved, frustrated man even prostitutes don\'t want as a customer, her idea to comfort her fathers economical problems with incest, and a personal encounter with Jesus who advises Dorothea to have sex with the mad and the lunatic to become happy\x85 It sounds like a porn-revue from the asylum, and in some way, it is. But it\'s also an astonishing insight, a hallucinating voyage seen through the eyes of an, after all, innocent girl that tries to understand why things are the way they are. She keeps her innocence throughout her experiences – almost, at all (there\'s one ""guilt"" appearing out of the middle all those unredeemed sins). German writer Martin Walser called it a film in ""Dosto-Sado-Maso-Jewski""-qualities when it came out, newspapers spoke of a ""moralistic fable"", of ""Sex with a slice of Mao"", and the film was nicknamed the ""Maria Magdalena of the red-light district"" or ""Alice in Sexland"".

Most of the actors and actresses were really professional. Adam, (played by Bruce N.) is an excellent actor, and I also liked the British actor. I loved the audition for the singers to be in the musical. Great job there, it was definitely a 'laugh-out-loud' moment.

tt0111255,"{'data-review-id': 'rw3042784', 'full_review': ""The best thing about The Specialist is the performance of James Woods, who really sinks his teeth into his villainous role and is enormously entertaining. What he also does that is good is making his material more interesting than it deserved to be, much has been said about the scene with the shirt and for good reason. Eric Roberts is pretty good also, he doesn't have anywhere near as much to do and his character is rather one-note but somehow Roberts does bring some intensity and menace whenever he appears. The scenery is lovely too, the sex scene was appropriately steamy and John Barry's score is the other of the two assets most worth noting about The Specialist. Barry was one of the all-time great film composers and I have yet to hear a bad score from him, and the music for The Specialist has his typical lushness, beautiful harmonic writing and moodiness, these things may seem out of place for a film such as this but actually it works. Unfortunately very little else works. Sylvester Stallone is not the best of actors but as an action star he showed great charisma. Here he is very wooden and mumbles his way through his lines. Sharon Stone also flounders, Stone has shown she can be good(she is brilliant in Casino) but she does look awkward and there is the sense that her heart wasn't really in it, which makes her character's predicament difficult to engage with. Regarding the chemistry between them too, the only time where it works is in the sex scene, everywhere else you'll struggle to find any kind of passion. Coming off worst was Rod Steiger, giving a performance so embarrassingly over-the-top it was like watching a cartoon, which was completely out of kilter with the rest of the film. The characters have no real depth and personality, the most colourful character was James Woods's and his performance itself has a lot to do with it. The dialogue has its moments, all of which with Woods again, but on the most part it's very weak, often lacking sense and flow and often aimless with far too much talk. Story-wise, the lack of originality concept-wise can be forgiven(revenge thrillers often have that but it's not always a bad thing) but for it to be plodding, laughably implausible and at times incoherent is less forgivable, as well as parts being so predictable any suspense and tension is severely diluted and having parts that have little to no relevance. Other than revenge, you don't have a clear idea as to what the heroine's motivations are. The action sequences lack any kind of momentum or excitement and just looks so awkwardly staged and passionless, a few are so ridiculous that it brings unintentional laughter. The direction is flat and with the vibe that he didn't know how to direct a thriller, and visually only the scenery really impresses, some of the colours are nice but others are garish and the film in terms of photography and editing does often look like direct-to-video quality. Overall, Woods, the shirt scene and the score are great, Roberts, the sex scene and scenery are good but the script, story, leads and Steiger are just bad and the film on the whole is mediocre. 4/10 Bethany Cox"", 'rating_value': '4', 'review_date': '1 July 2014', 'reviewer_name': 'TheLittleSongbird', 'reviewer_url': '/user/ur20552756/', 'short_review': ""Mediocre revenge thriller made watchable by Woods's performance and John Barry's score""}"

But when his partner refuses--and the bomb subsequently explodes and kills both passengers--a fight ensues which results in extremely bad feelings between them afterward. The scene then shifts to Miami where a beautiful woman named ""May Munro"" (Sharon Stone) has requested that Ray kill three men who murdered her parents when she was a child. The problem is that Ray is an explosives expert and doesn\'t feel comfortable with the job at hand. But after following May in order to gather more information concerning the task at hand he reluctantly agrees. Yet even though his assignment is certainly difficult, what he doesn\'t know is that Ned has formed an uneasy business partnership with these men, and he has been forewarned that Ray might be coming after them. Needless to say, Ned would love another opportunity to get back at Ray for what happened earlier. At any rate, having reviewed the basic plot I must admit that, in spite of the solid cast, this film turned out to be more than a little disappointing. For starters, it appeared that neither Sylvester Stallone nor Sharon Stone really cared that much about this film and simply went through the motions.

Sly Stallone mumbles so badly that only about 5% of his dialogue is intelligible (though this is probably a plus, given the quality of the writing).Sharon Stone is nice to look at but her acting starts off bad and gets worse in a hurry. Her character is so unlikeable I cheered up when Woods slapped her around. Rod Steiger\'s accent, which I believe is supposed to be Cuban because he pronounces ""you"" as ""chew"" a la Scarface, comes and goes. James Woods plays a parody of himself (this was actually the most entertaining thing about the movie). They show Sly working out, and all he does are ballet-like stretches to show off his bod, and it was not a pretty sight. He is so over-pumped that there are alarmingly bulging veins on every inch of his body visible. Stone and Stallone (has a nice ring to it, huh?) have no chemistry--during their big sex scene, they look extremely bored instead of aroused, as if they are about to doze off but the only thing keeping them awake is to make sure their buff bodies are displayed carefully so they look their best on camera.  Continuity is terrible-Sly\'s character adopts a fluffy grey kitty, which I guess is supposed to make him sensitive (I was just worried he\'d crush it accidentally) but in a scene towards the end, the cat is dark brown. I give a grudging point towards the kitty not being killed by the Columbians or Woods--the one thing that I didn\'t see coming, because every time Sly came home looking for his cat I expected him to find it nailed to the wall or something equally hideous. Woods does have a great scene (a couple, really) where he does a little trick with a pen and some plastique to frighten his office staff. I also laughed at the way he\'d constantly be yelling ""Shut up!"" to characters who hadn\'t even said anything yet.The movie is, I have to admit, one of those that is so bad, it would qualify as one of those \'love to hate it\' movies that you sit around with your friends with to watch and make fun of.

Cagney's character is a frontiersman who makes and lives by his own rules. He firmly believes that 'fear keeps men honest' and should this involve dangling the occasional horse thief from a rope then so be it. Judged by his times however does this make him 'bad'?

This is a complex, heart-wrenching tale powerfully etched by the dexterous hands of Anup Singh. The movie starts off with the backdrop of the 1947 Partition of India and the theme of loss runs right through it. The film then goes on to mercilessly expose the ridiculous limits a patriarchy must go to, to preserve itself. Umber (played by the incomparable Irrfan Khan) is a Sikh man uprooted with his wife and three young daughters from his village (in Pakistan) and forced to flee to the new India as a result of Partition. Soon after he is somewhat reestablished in India, his wife delivers a 4th daughter; at this point Umber declares he\'s had a son and brushing aside all objections proceeds to raise the girl as a boy even up to the point of marrying her off as a man. The absolutism of the patriarchy, accompanied by the threat of violence runs as an undercurrent throughout the film — the women mostly watch on helplessly until Umber\'s daughter-in-law unexpectedly decides to question the status quo. But it is too late and the story unfolds inexorably into a disaster for all. Thematically Partition as the starting point for the film is a powerful and relevant one. The patriarchy that invented the concept of ""honor"" off the backs of its helpless women then greatly exploited it during Partition - women, girls on all sides and as a matter of priority, were raped, mutilated, and devastated in ways unimaginable. The same patriarchy so bound to its feudal ties, the land it owned and a limited imagination, could only consider sons bearing its name. And this became so much of a part of the reality that not having a male heir became as much a matter of economic devastation as of social shame. As the director and screenplay writer, Anup Singh displays admirable restraint with limited dialog, nuanced performances elicited from his cast, and the straightforward telling of an explosive story. A metaphorical twist in the story leaves you stunned yet believing. I would be remiss if I did not call out the three women actors - Tilottama Shome, Tisca Chopra and Rasika Dugal - who were perfect in their respective roles; each held her own vis-a-vis Irrfan Khan.

What he doesn\'t count on, however, is the sudden arrival of two cowboys named ""Tucson Smith"" (Guinn \'Big Boy\' Williams) and ""Stoney Martin"" (Al St. John) who have befriended one of his intended victims by the name of ""Charlie Hayden"" (Lafe McKee) who is determined to reveal the identity of the person financing these murderous raids. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an okay film which, because of the obvious limitations of the film industry at the time, might require the viewer to make certain allowances. And while the picture quality, sound and editing aren\'t necessarily that good, it does have the distinction of being the first film to debut the character of Tucson Smith who eventually became a member of the acclaimed ""Three Mesquiteers"" from Republic Pictures grade-B movie fame. Be that as it may, while this is certainly not a great Western by any means, I suppose it passed the time well enough, and I have rated it accordingly.

Although, it was a remake of a Tamil film ""Adhutha Vittu Penn"", I thought the Hindi version was EQUALLY amazing and not to mention immensely entertaining =) I thought performance-wise Kishore, STOLE THE SHOW! I cannot imagine the movie without him. The guy is incredible at comedy. Sunil Dutt was fabulous, I just adore him to bits, he is so underrated...he put in a stupendous performance! ROFL gotta love the scene where he attempts to learn music from Kishore...he had me in splits. As for Mehmood, he simply rocked. \'Daaaaaai\' bhola . I liked his unique accent. haha. I think its imitated by plenty of actors till date and yes, its annoying to the core. Saira, well I usually find her very irritating in most of her films, I thought she was passable. The soundtrack was amazing. Ahhh...man I can just listen to them all day long. My personal favorites include kehna hai, mera samne wali ladki ne and main chali is one of best female duets sung by Asha and Lata. The movie is a must watch, it\'s a classic in every sense.

The rest of the cast is good, too, but for me the main interest was to see a film where the actors (Mehmood & Kumar) do their own playback singing, which I believe became fairly uncommon after the 1940s. These guys deliver, and steal the show whenever they are on screen. Then on top of that, Kishore's character, Guru, after Bhola (Dutt) hilariously demonstrates that he can't learn to sing, pulls a Cyrano and provides the voice for Bhola's picturizing. Then song duel with Masterji, too much, Guru working Bhola like puppet. Guru's troupe (including Bhola) are a gang of 5, working like a chorus, double-takes timed to the music. The scene where they go to Bhola's uncle to change his mind about his engagement is structured as a pretty much a cappella song. I love that.

In fact, it's a fairly well-thought out, well-shot movie. The dialogue is absurd, but quote-worthy. That's if you enjoy the film. It's garnered a love-hate relationship with movie audiences since it came out.\nI'm disappointed it hasn't gotten the cult status the movie like The Room has gotten. The Room was just plain bad, terrible acting, directing, etc... Freddy Got Fingered on the other hand, was sharp, witty, and yes, offensive, but in a movie way.\nWhy does Freddy Got Fingered really work. Think of it as Tom Green's f-u to Hollywood. Not that he hated Hollywood, at least I don't think he did. But he did EXPLOIT its excesses in the movie. I mean, the giant explosion alone is an example of this, probably blowing a huge budget on that scene, which I highly doubt was in the original script the way it turned out.\nHe's not only exploiting Hollywood on the budget, but also on what is considered offensive. How did he get away with all the stuff he did? I'm surprised it made it through with an R rating. Tom really pushed the boundaries of decency all for comedy, but looking back at it now, it's almost like he foresaw the way things would go in real life. I mean, everything today is about hyperbole and over reaction, or instant gratification.\nI also look at the movie as a parallel to Tom Green's life, and how he got the money to make the movie. If you're easily offended, then of course you will hate this movie. The casting was also perfect. Harlan Williams as the best friend, Rip Torn as angry dad, Marisa Coughlan as the girlfriend (she had to say and do some crazy things).

tt3074578,"{'data-review-id': 'rw3338351', 'full_review': 'Sean Astin and Chris Mukley provide fine performances in director Gil Cates Jr. suspenseful film centered on two desperate men who have a chance meeting in the middle of Lake Michigan. Mitch (Astin) is determined to kill himself because he blames himself for his father\'s death in a factory accident. Kelly Enright (Mulkey) crashes his plane into the Lake while on a delivery of a backpack with $125,000 for either drugs or black market human body parts. Both men are desperately searching for hope and identity in their lives. The videography is stunning, and the writing creates a realistic give and take of hostility until each man realizes he must depend upon the other for survival. The film begins with a dream-like sequence of Mitch preparing for his trip out onto Lake Michigan (and his eventual suicide). He meticulously preps for his day, fills a bird feeder with enough seed to last several weeks, then visits his mother (who is suffering from Alzheimer\'s disease) in a nursing home. After making certain that everything he is leaving behind is in order, Mitch motors his father\'s small fishing boat out into the lake. Soon Mitch discovers the wreckage of a small plane and pulls the pilot (Kelly), who had been clinging to part of one of the wings, into his craft. The remainder of the film entails Mitch and Kelly discussing bleaker anecdotes of life that all of us experience and, often, keep to ourselves. Mitch has suffered the loss of his girlfriend through a skate boarding accident, the death of his father through the warehouse accident, and his mother to Alzheimer\'s. Through a chance cell phone call from the men who are awaiting Kelly\'s arrival with the money, Mitch is able to contact 911 and both men are rescued by the Coast Guard stationed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By the time of the rescue both men have helped each discover that hope survives. As Kelly said to Mitch during one of Mitch\'s self-indulgent diatribes, ""...don\'t do that to yourself [...] people have choices..."". This is a must see Indy film. The acting is sound, the writing is crisp and honest, the directing is insightful, and the videography is stunning and haunting.', 'rating_value': '8', 'review_date': '19 October 2015', 'reviewer_name': 'jamuxcincy', 'reviewer_url': '/user/ur63287018/', 'short_review': 'A story of survival, friendship, and hope.'}"

He runs over a small aircraft, damaging the boat, finds the pilot and drags him aboard. The propellor on the boat is gone so they are stuck and the pilot is injured. So far, so good. Then..well, not a lot really. We are told their stories in flashback. The pilot is delivering a backpack to some dodgy guys who he insists will kill him. In the end they popped up, got the backpack and left. Possibly the biggest anticlimax in film history. There was no real sense of danger with them being stuck on the boat as, well, they were on a lake, a big lake granted but still not the middle of the Atlantic. The two deaths that Mitch felt responsible for were laughable and overall the story wasn't really well thought out.\nThe acting went between okay and ridiculous which disappointed me as I watched Sean Martin in Stranger Things and thought he was great in it but I suppose some blame has to be attributed to the director. The ending, I'm assuming, was supposed to be uplifting and inspirational but I don't think it would be too long before he was back out on the lake for his next suicide attempt if his big life turn around was a new fish and a job in a care home.\nThese kind of films that don't have a lot of action need to keep us gripped with good storylines and solid acting but I'm afraid this one was just blah.

The film was extremely well cast, with convincing character portrayals, including a highly memorable performance by Marshall Napier. Northspur explores how humans might interact in extreme circumstances, if they are forced into 'survival mode' in an apocalyptic setting. So, you will get to see some brilliantly executed (violent) action scenes throughout, which are beautifully interspersed with moving, heartfelt segments, and the film's threads of faith and hope add even more layers of substance and interest. Congratulations to director Aaron Falvey, writer Justin Eade, and the amazing cast and crew of Northspur - it's a remarkable achievement and is definitely worth watching!"", 'rating_value': '9', 'review_date': '12 September 2022', 'reviewer_name': 'enjoyadevineday', 'reviewer_url': '/user/ur156674376/', 'short_review': 'Phenomenally good!'}"
